/*  Exercise 2:
 *  Implement the below trait, and write a meaningful test.
 *  Suggestion:
 *  - reuse Sequences and Optionals as imported above
 *  - Course is a simple case classes with just the name
 *  - Teacher is a case class with name and sequence of courses
 *  - School is a case class with (sequences of) teachers and courses
 *  - add/set methods below create the new school
